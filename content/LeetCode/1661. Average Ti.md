## Problem
There is a factory website that has several machines each running the **same number of processes**. Write a solution to find the **average time** each machine takes to complete a process.

The time to complete a process is the `'end' timestamp` minus the `'start' timestamp`. The average time is calculated by the total time to complete every process on the machine divided by the number of processes that were run.

The resulting table should have the `machine_id` along with the **average time** as `processing_time`, which should be **rounded to 3 decimal places**.

Return the result table in **any order**.

The result format is in the following example.

## My Answer.
```python
import pandas as pd

def get_average_time(activity: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
	activity.sort_values(by=['machine_id', 'process_id'], inplace=True)
	
	activity_start = activity[activity['activity_type']=='start'].copy().reset_index(drop=True)
	activity_end = activity[activity['activity_type']=='end'].copy().reset_index(drop=True)
	
	activity_start['processing_time'] = activity_end['timestamp'] - activity_start['timestamp']	
	return activity_start.groupby('machine_id')['processing_time'].mean().round(3).to_frame().reset_index()
```
